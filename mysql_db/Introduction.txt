It is initially developed by mysql 
later it is aquired by sun micro system. 
later it is aquired by Oracle 

basic data types 
==================
string 
=====

varchar 
numeri type data 
==================
int 
bigint

================

datetime

create a emp table with following structure

Data Types, 
Constraints (
    NOT NULL, UNIQUE, 
    PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, 
    DEFAULT, CHECK)


Constraints in SQL are rules applied to columns or entire tables within a relational database to enforce data integrity and ensure the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the stored information. They restrict the type of data that can be entered, updated, or deleted, preventing invalid or inconsistent data from corrupting the database. 

NOT NULL:
Ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values, requiring an explicit value for every row in that column.

UNIQUE:
Guarantees that all values in a specified column or set of columns are distinct, preventing duplicate entries.

PRIMARY KEY:
Uniquely identifies each row in a table. It combines the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints and serves as the primary identifier for records within the table.


FOREIGN KEY:
Establishes a link between data in two tables, enforcing referential integrity. It ensures that values in a column (or set of columns) in one table correspond to values in a primary key or unique key in another table.

CHECK:
Enforces a specific condition on the values in a column, ensuring that only data meeting the defined criteria can be entered.

DEFAULT:
Assigns a default value to a column if no value is explicitly provided during an INSERT operation.


select clause 
==================
select clause used to retrieve the data from table. 
ex: 
select colum1, column2, colum3 etc... from table_name; 

display empno, emp name , job and salary details of emp table
select empno, ename, job, sal from emp;
whild character - * 
which is used to represent all columns of the table

display all columns of the table.

select * from emp;

arithmetic operators 
======================
+
-
*
/
%

provide 150 as bonus on each salary.
select empno, ename, job, sal, sal + 150 from emp;

calculate gst as 18%
select empno, ename, job, sal, sal*18/100 from emp;

field alias names 
=================
filed alias names are provide after filed or column 
usually by using as keyword. 

select empno, ename, job, 
sal, sal*18/100 as gst from emp;

find the net salary 
sal - gst 

working with null values 
==========================
is null 
is not null 

display all employees who are getting commision.

select * from emp where comm is null;

working with where clause 
=============================
where clause allowes us to applica some conditions 
and retrieve the date , the records 
which satisfies the condition. 

relational operators 
======================
>
>= 
<
<= 
== 
!= 

display all emp who are working for deptno 10
display all emp who are working for deptno 20
display all emp who are working for deptno 30

display all emp who are working as job 'CLERK';
display all emp who are working as job 'MANAGER';
display all emp who are working as job 'SALESMAN';
display all emp who are working as job 'ANALYST';

display all emp whose salary is more than 2500; 
select * from emp where sal > 2500;
display all emp whose salary is balow  2500; 
select * from emp where sal < 2500;

logical operators 
=================
and 
or 
not 

display all emp whose salary is 
above 2000 and below 4000;

select * from emp where sal>=2000 and sal<=4000;

sql operators 
===============
between 
not between 
in 
not in 

is null 
is not nul

display all emp whose salary is 
above 2000 and below 4000 using between 

display all emp whose salary is 
below 2000 and above 4000;
or 
display all emp whose salary is 
not in the range of above 2000 and below 4000

display all employees who are working 
in deptno either 10 or 30;

select clause 
where clause 
order by clause 
It is used arrange the data in sorting order 
based on specified column or multiple columns. 

display all employees in soring order based on 
salaries asscending order 

display all employees in soring order based on 
salaries descending order

display all employees in soring order based on 
emp names 

display all employees in soring order based on 
jobs 

display all employees in soring order based on 
deptno

limit clause 
============
it is used to fetch specified no of records 

suppose we say limit 5; 
only top 5 records will be fetched. 

display first 3 recods of the emp table; 
display first 5 recods of the emp table;
display first 2 recods of the emp table;

display top 3 salaried employees details;
display first 3 smallest salaried employees details;

working with distinct clause 
===============================
It is used to get the unique data from specified column
Note: this kind of distinct can be 
applicable only on grouping columns ex 
dept, and job and mgr, or hiredate etc. 

requirement: 
display all department no which are available. 
select distinct deptno from;
display all jobs which are available.
select distinct job from emp;

INSERT, 
UPDATE, 
DELETE, 
WHERE clause, 
ORDER BY, 
LIMIT

INSERT,:it is used to insert the record into table.  
    syntax: 
    insert into table_name values (
        data for all fields separated by columns
    )
    or
    insert into (list of selected columns) 
    values (data for selected columns)

    inserting one record with full data.

    insert into emp values (101, "Anil", "Business Analyst", 7836, date('2022-5-12'), 4500, NULL, 10)
UPDATE, : to modify the data 
    while modifying the data using where clause 
    is recommended then updations 
    will be applicable for only those records,
    which are qualified by where clause.

    ex: increse anil salary by 200 dollars.
    update table_name set column_name1=new_data,  
    column_name2=new_data,
    where clause;
    update emp set sal = sal + 200 where empno = 101;
DELETE, 
WHERE clause, 
ORDER BY, 
LIMIT
