working with useRef() hook 
========================
useRef() hook allowes us to access the elemnt DOM object 
directly and allowed to modify element properties. 
technically it is technically called as uncontrolled elements also. 

props 
========
props is a built in object. 
which is used pass the data between components. 
It is acting as bridge between components to exchange the data. 

we can do this communication in 2 ways 
1)parent to child component 
2)child to parent component. 

note: props is a read only object. 

1)parent to child component
===========================
It is very simple approach, like html attributes syntax, 
we are sending data to child component. 
child componet function has props as argument, which is receiving the data. 

2)child to parent component. 
To meet this requirement, parent component should pass 
a function prop with argument has to be passed to child component.

programmatical navigation 
============================
programmatical navigation we can achieve in function components 
by using useNavigate() hook. 

working with custom hooks 
===========================
custom hook name shoud be prefix with useXxx().

useState()
useEffect() 
useRef() 
useNavigate() 

rules to use hooks 
======================
hooks should be used top level of the component.
hooks are developed for the purpose of functional components. 
Not allowed to use under conditional statements, 
loop statements. 
Not allowed to used in nested functions. 
hooks look like as normal js fuctions, 
but ment to use only in side of react functional components.
