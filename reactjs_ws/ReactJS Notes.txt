working with useRef() hook 
========================
useRef() hook allowes us to access the elemnt DOM object 
directly and allowed to modify element properties. 
technically it is technically called as uncontrolled elements also. 

props 
========
props is a built in object. 
which is used pass the data between components. 
It is acting as bridge between components to exchange the data. 

we can do this communication in 2 ways 
1)parent to child component 
2)child to parent component. 

note: props is a read only object. 

1)parent to child component
===========================
It is very simple approach, like html attributes syntax, 
we are sending data to child component. 
child componet function has props as argument, which is receiving the data. 

2)child to parent component. 
To meet this requirement, parent component should pass 
a function prop with argument has to be passed to child component.
